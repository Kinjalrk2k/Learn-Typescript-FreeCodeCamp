# Learn TypeScript - Full Course for Beginners (FreeCodeCamp)

- Javascript in OK for small or medium sized projects. For larger projects, we preder to use TypeScript.
- TypeScript > JavaScript:
  - Getting errors while transpiling (in the editor or in the console) rather than in the runtime
  - JavaScript code is difficult to maintain and scale.
  - There's no strong datatypes in JavaScript, we cant create entities. In contrary, TypeScript has strong entities with properties
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, in other words, it acts like an extension. Changing JavaScript to TypeScript is easy
- TypeScript cannot be run directly in the browsers, as they dont support it. TypeScript needs to be transpiled to JavaScript before we can use it in browser

## TypeScript Tools

- NodeJS
- TypeScript: `npm install -g typescript`
- Check the version of TypeScript `tsc -v`
